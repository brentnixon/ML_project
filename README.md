# Supervised Fraud -- Machine Learning with the Enron Fraud Dataset
__Brent Nixon, Feb. 2018__

## Introduction <a id='Introduction'></a>

>The goal of this project was to build a model that, trained on financial and email data for the Enron employees, could then predict whether an unseen employee, by virtue of their data, was a person-of-interest (POI) in the fraud investigation. 

> Machine learning is useful to this end because it allows us to examine a large body of data points that hold patterns which we would not necessarily be able to identify through simple analysis. A machine learning model takes that body of disparate data, 'learns' patterns in it that correspond to a particular label, and determines how closely that new unit matches the patterns associated with each label, resulting in a prediction for membership in a class/label.
